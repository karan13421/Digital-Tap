# Digital-Tap
As we know the use of wash basins at this time is still using the conventional system of using mechanical
                taps controlled by humans. Users also often face the problem where it is easily damaged by the
                negligence of other users. The tap in the public toilets used to
                get damage within a year. Due to this water starts leaking through the tap which leads to the wastage of
                water. The Automatic Digital Tap is an easy, efficient, user convenient and economical tap. Even though,
                the <em>digital tap</em> has already been implemented in the
                real world but this tap is an attempt to reduce the power consumption and the cost as well. The
                <em>digital tap</em> can work with a very low power supply and without any use of water pump and
                separate tank. The existing <em>digital tap</em> make use of solenoid which has only two
                states i.e. ON and OFF state. But <em>digital tap</em> can also control the flow of water. Also solenoid
                consumes a lot of power to run. Our digital tap does not make use of any solenoid. Besides this, we use
                geared motor which is able to do the same task in the 5V power supply
                which is less than solenoid power consumption, as we are not using solenoid, it will directly effect on
                the cost. The cost of the existing digital tap available in the market is between Rs 3000 to Rs 12000.
                But the cost of <em>digital tap</em> is just Rs 1500 with modes such as
                Drinking Tap mode, Toilet Tap mode, Hand washing tap mode, Watering mode and functionalities of water
                flow control and timer. We are also providing a feature which can sense the humidity of the soil and can
                water plants.
